## üèó Architecture Overview

QRBuddy is a **Deno Fresh** application that generates beautiful gradient QR codes. It follows Fresh's island architecture pattern where interactive components are hydrated on the client while the rest remains server-rendered HTML.

### Core Architecture Patterns

1. **Island Architecture**: Interactive components live in `/islands/` and are selectively hydrated on the client. Each island is a self-contained Preact component with its own state management via signals.

2. **Signal-Based State**: Uses Preact signals for reactive state management across components. Key signals:
   - `url`: The URL to encode in the QR code
   - `style`: Current selected gradient style (sunset, pool, terminal, candy, vapor, brutalist)
   - `triggerDownload`/`triggerCopy`: Action triggers that components watch via useEffect

3. **Component Communication**: Islands communicate through shared signals passed as props from the parent route (`routes/index.tsx`). This allows decoupled components to react to state changes without direct dependencies.

### Key Technical Decisions

- **QR Generation**: Uses `qr-code-styling` library for gradient support and advanced styling options
- **Styling**: Twind (runtime Tailwind) with custom theme configuration in `twind.config.ts`
- **No Build Step**: Fresh's JIT compilation means no bundler configuration needed
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout with Deno's built-in type checking

### Component Responsibilities

**Route (`routes/index.tsx`)**
- Initializes all shared signals
- Orchestrates component layout
- Handles SEO meta tags

**Islands (Interactive Components)**
- `QRCanvas`: Core QR rendering and download/copy functionality
- `ShuffleButton`: Random style selection with spring animation
- `URLInput`: URL entry with validation
- `StylePills`: Style selector UI
- `ActionButtons`: Download trigger
- `KeyboardHandler`: Global keyboard shortcuts (s for shuffle, d for download, c for copy)
- `EasterEggs`: Hidden features and animations

**Utils (`utils/qr-styles.ts`)**
- Style definitions with gradient configurations
- Each style defines dots, background, cornersSquare, and cornersDot properties

### State Flow Pattern

1. User interaction in an island component updates a signal
2. Signal change triggers useEffect hooks in dependent components
3. QRCanvas watches url/style signals and regenerates QR on change
4. Action signals (triggerDownload/triggerCopy) are set to true, consumed by QRCanvas, then reset to false

### Deployment

- **Primary**: Deno Deploy (zero-config deployment from GitHub)
- **Alternative**: Any Deno-compatible host via `deno run -A main.ts`

## üé® Design System

QRBuddy follows Pablo's "Soft Brutal" aesthetic:
- **Chunky borders**: 4px black borders with custom shadow classes
- **Warm pastels**: Cream backgrounds with gradient accents
- **Spring animations**: Squish, rotate-shuffle, and pop effects
- **Gradient themes**: 6 pre-defined gradient styles emphasizing visual delight

## üìù Development Notes

- Always run `deno fmt && deno lint` after making changes
- The QR library expects specific gradient object structures - maintain type compatibility
- Twind configuration is runtime-only - no PostCSS or build-time CSS generation
- Fresh automatically handles code splitting for islands - keep islands focused and minimal
